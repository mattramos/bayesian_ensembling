Welcome to Bayesian Ensembles's documentation!
==================================================================

The Bayesian Ensembles package provides a framework for practioners to construct probabilistic ensembles models. The package is built on top of `xarray <https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/>`_ and `Jax <https://github.com/google/jax>`_ making operations efficient and scalable to large datasets that are possibly high-dimensional.

Code for this package is developed by `Matt Amos <https://github.com/mattramos>`_ and `Thomas Pinder <https://github.com/thomaspinder>`_.You can view the source code for GPJax `here on Github <https://github.com/thomaspinder/bayesian_ensembling>`_.
